## EggProductionBackend Using Clean Arcitecture##
### We will build a backend in which it will be possible to register how many eggs my chickens are producing on a daily, monthly and yearly basis and as the app grows, we will add more features. ###
#### This codebase is going to be used inside a videoseries I am creating about creating a backend in C#. ####
##### In this series we will be using working with:
   * C# .net Core 3.1 
   * A .net Core Web API used to Create, Read, Update and Delete Data (REST API)
   * Working with the CLEAN arcitecture where that is designed using parts of Onion and Hexagon Arcitecture
   * Deploying the Backend System to Azure (and having it setup differently for Development and prodution)
   * Setting up Security (Authorisation and Authentication)
   * Adding Socket.io for Realtime Communication Between Backend and Frontend
   * Unit testing all Services using TDD
   * Work as developers and get our tasks from a Kanban Board. (Gonna use Kanbanflow.com)
   * More will be added as the application progress!
